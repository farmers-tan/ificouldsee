# Research: Government spending data: United States Federal Government: Competitive bidding (FBO/FPDS)
One of the mechanisms that the United States Federal Government uses to buy goods and services is competitive bidding. By some reported estimates, competitive bidding represents only about 20% of United States Federal Government spending. However, learning about this spending can be comparatively easier than spending through other mechanisms since this spending is documented in publicly accessible databases: [FedBizOps (FBO)](https://www.fbo.gov/) and the [Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS)](https://www.fpds.gov/).

[FBO](https://www.fbo.gov/) and [FPDS](https://www.fpds.gov/) are without argument both terrible to use, with [FPDS](https://www.fpds.gov/) being at least an order of magnitude worse than [FBO](https://www.fbo.gov/). But, with some patience, data can be extracted from each that can be used to learn about United States Federal Government spending through competitive bidding.
