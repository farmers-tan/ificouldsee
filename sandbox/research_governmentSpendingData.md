# Research: Government spending data
## Why does looking at spending data work?
Some of the core assumptions underlying research in _If I Could See What You See_ are that:
* There are goods and services that, either because they are not inherently governmental functions or because they are inherently _not_ governmental functions, governments will buy from outside of government
* There are goods and services that, with not _inherently_ not governmental functions, governments may still _choose_ to buy from outside of government
* Between governments different governments may have different practices around purchasing the same types of goods and services
* Within governments different subdivisions of a government may have different practices around purchasing the same types of goods and services
* ... and finally, flowing from the previous assumptions, goods and services that one government or subdivision of government may produce themselves may be goods or services that another government or subdivision of government may buy from outside government

From a research point of view, this means that looking at the marketplace for goods or services in an environment where these goods and services are bought outside of government can provide insight into what these goods and services look like in situations where these same goods or services are produced within government.

## How does looking at government spending data work in the context of surveillance?
In the context of surveillance, this might play out in the United States through looking at training for local police forces in order to understand surveillance within the Federal government, or through looking at training for the military in order to understand surveillance within local law enforcement, or both. Wherever you as a researcher can find information on government spending, you can use it to give you a point if view on the subject as a whole.
