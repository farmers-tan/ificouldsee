# Introduction
As a source, surveillance operator memoirs offer a wide range of material—and a wide range of quality. The text can be mined for information on operator recruitment, selection and assessment, training, and operational tactics, techniques, and procedures. Memoirs also frequently contain images from the author's personal collection that can provide unique views inside these phases of an operator's work life. (v1.0 July 17, 2017)



# "The Troubles," et al.: Northern Ireland, United Kingdom, 1968-present
## Background
The Troubles (Irish: Na Trioblóidí) was an ethno-nationalist conflict in Northern Ireland during the late 20th century. Also known internationally as the Northern Ireland conflict, it is sometimes described as a "guerrilla war" or "low-level war". The conflict began in the late 1960s and is usually deemed to have ended with the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. Although the Troubles mainly took place in Northern Ireland, violence spilled over at times into parts of the Republic of Ireland, England and mainland Europe.[1](#1)

## Organizations/Units
### 14 Intelligence Company AKA 14 Int AKA 14 Coy AKA The Det AKA The Group
**Background**

The Special Reconnaissance Unit, also known as the 14 Field Security and Intelligence Company (internally "The Det") was a part of the British Army Intelligence Corps involved in plain-clothes operations in Northern Ireland from the 1970s onwards. The unit conducted undercover surveillance operations against suspected members of Irish republican and loyalist paramilitary groups. Its troops were recruited from line battalions and trained in an eight-week course by the Special Air Service (SAS). An initial deployment of 120 men took place in November 1972. Many allegations of collusion with loyalist paramilitaries were made against the unit. In 1987, the unit became part of the newly formed United Kingdom Special Forces directorate. The unit was amalgamated with the Special Reconnaissance Regiment or SRR in 2005.[2](#2)

### Military Reaction Force (MRF) AKA Military Reconnaissance Force AKA Mobile Reconnaissance Force
**Background**

The Military Reaction Force, Military Reconnaissance Force or Mobile Reconnaissance Force (MRF) was a covert intelligence-gathering and counter-insurgency unit of the British Army active in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, a former member described it as a "legalised death squad". The unit was formed during the summer of 1971 and operated until late 1972 or early 1973. MRF teams operated in plain-clothes and civilian vehicles, equipped with pistols and sub-machine guns. They were tasked with tracking down and arresting, or killing, members of the Irish Republican Army (IRA). The MRF also ran double agents within the paramilitary groups and ran a number of front companies to gather intelligence. In October 1972, the Provisional IRA uncovered and attacked two of the MRF's front companies—a mobile laundry service and a massage parlour—which contributed to the unit's dissolution.[3](#3)
