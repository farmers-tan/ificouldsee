# Government contractor information
## Introduction
Amongst highly developed militaries in the later half of the 20th century and into the beginning of the 21st century, many functions that were formerly organic to the military became more and more functions that are performed by private contractors. Surveillance training is one of these.

This is not to say that surveillance training is exclusively performed by contractors; it would be a challenge to categorically make such a claim. But it is true, at least in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and nations within Western Europe, that there are private contractors—often staffed with former military and government operators—who do provide surveillance training that is substantively similar to training that is provided by military or government organizations. And, in some specific subject areas, contractor-provided training has entirely replaced training from organic military or government sources.

## Information types
### Company websites and company LinkedIn profiles
**Description**

Government contractors sit on enormous amounts of information about surveillance. Like an iceberg, most lies unseen beneath the surface, and only a small part—in this case, publically-facing material like websites and LinkedIn profiels—can be seen.

As with any other type of business, a government contractor's website may be more or less useful in telling you what it is they do. Within any industry there develops a specific language which is intelligible to insiders and unintelligible to outsiders, and government contracting is no exception. Specifically, within contractor's who provide surveillance training, language can be even more unintelligible.

### Training course descriptions
**Description**

While few if any companies provide a detailed description of their courses, many provide top-level descriptions. And while an individual course description may not be particularly descriptive, a set of descriptions may begin to suggest patterns.

### Equipment technical data sheets
**Description**

In addition to training, some companies also produce or sell specialized technical equipment used in surveillance. Frequently, this equipment has technical data sheets that describe its functions and capabilities. These functions and capabilities can then be used to suggest possible requirements that the equipment was designed to address, and from this possible training that would be required to use to equipment to address these requirements.
