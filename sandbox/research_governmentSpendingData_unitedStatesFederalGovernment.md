# Research: Government spending data: United States Federal Government
It is well beyond the scope of _If I Could See What You See_ to describe, in total, how the United States Federal Government spends money.

What is _relevant_ about United States Federal Government spending to _If I Could See What You See_ is that:
* The United States Federal Government spends a lot
* The United States Federal Government spends a lot on goods and services that it buys outside of government
* Of all United States Federal Government, a large percentage is on defense spending
* Of all United States Federal Government defense spending, a not insignificant percentage is spent on goods and services bought outside of government
* Of all United States Federal Government defense spending on goods and services bought outside of government, at least some of the goods and services that are bought are related to surveillance

There are different spending mechanisms within the United States Federal Government, all of which can be used to purchase goods and services related to surveillance. These mechanisms range from a simple credit card for small purchases to open and competitive bidding processes for the largest purchases. Each mechanism has its own accounting and reporting requirements. These requirements drive how information about these purchases is recorded, and also drive how this information is then made accessible to the public.

Understanding how any one of these mechanisms work and how information about spending within them works can take a career to master. As an indication of how complicated and lucrative the market for understanding this information is, [Bloomberg](https://bloomberg.com/) is just one of many private companies that analyzes and sells analysis of this information. Some tools are free, some—like [Bloomberg's](https://about.bgov.com/), which costs upwards of $1000 a month for a year-long subscription—are not.
