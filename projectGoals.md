* "If I Could See What You See" is inherently a demystification project: it aims to take a practice—surveillance, and specifically surveillance photography—that many find obscure, or even secret, and to break this practice down into understandable pieces.
* "If I Could See What You See" also aims to develop tools for participants to acquire tacit knowledge of surveillance photography. Tacit knowledge is frequently defined as "knowing how" as opposed to "knowing of" or "knowing about." Surveillance and surveillance photography are embodied practices: they take place in physical space and are about understanding space and the relationships between people and activities and tools in space.
