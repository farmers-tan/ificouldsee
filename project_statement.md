"If I Could See What You See" is project to create an open-source surveillance photography workshop. It employs two of the common uses of the term "open-source": first, the project uses open-source information—as opposed to information that has restricted access, such as classified information—as research material; second, the project uses the infrastructure and methods of open-source software development projects—such as this GitHub repository—as a structure to organize the work of the project and to organize its products.
