Participants will use open-source research material depicting surveillance practices to develop step-by-step instructions to conducting aspects of surveillance operations. In this workshop, participants will review material depicting surveillance operators setting up and using indoor hide sites to conduct surveillance. Using a structured framework developed through the If I Could See What You See project, participants will first describe what they see in the research material and then work in small groups to try and build what they have described.
