"If I Could See What You See" is a project to create an open-source surveillance photography workshop. It employs two of the common uses of the term "open-source": first, the project uses open-source information—as opposed to information that has restricted access, such as classified information—as research material; second, the project uses the infrastructure and methods of open-source software development projects—such as this GitHub repository—as a structure to organize the work of the project and to organize its products.

The origins of "If I Could See What You See" date to January, 2016. This repository was created in July, 2017.

The repository will eventually contain the following information:
* Standard operating procedures (SOPs) to discover open-source information
* Source information discovered through the collection process
* SOPs to process information sources
* Workshop materials 
* Workshop documentation
* Working documents for the management of the project
